Work on button interactions with the user. So far, we have formatted and created buttons and tried experimenting with them. We must work on having the button accomplish a certain action over the next two weeks. To be more specific, I hope to create a button that, when pressed, will display a page with the hours of the day. Over the course of the two weeks, I hope to learn and implement button interactions in javascript and HTML. Right now, the buttons do nothing. They are formatted to look nice but that is about it. I hope to learn how to interact with the buttons in order to accomplish another screen that allows for further user input.
